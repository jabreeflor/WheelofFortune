Dr. Redmond,
We have been working on this project through Visual Studio Code and running using a live server. 
Please download "live server" by typing it in the search bar within the Extensions tab on the left side of the visual studio code window. 
To run please head to the "FinalGame.HTML" file in our folder via Visual Studio Code. Once it is open, please right click and click on the choice "OPEN WITH LIVE SERVER".
This should take you straight to our game.
